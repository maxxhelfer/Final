# Final
The purpose of this program will be to create a game. The game will implement linked lists to create a choose your own adventure. Based off the different paths you take and which items you collect along the way will determine if you are able to grow to fame and glory or fail the quests. The game will include 4 quests all of which you can fail, complete, retry or continue through the story. I plan to work alone on this project and write all of the stories myself. At the end of the story line it will print a custom summary of your path though the whole game and then you can choose to let your charater the continue to live or kill them off and start over.
