# Final
The purpose of this program will be to find a word read in a document in the example case a dictionary. The program will read the words into an array. From this array the user will input a word and the program will return wether or not it is in fact found in the document. In order to do this the program also must lowercase the input inorder to compare to the text in the file. The program will also print the array of words found in the document and read how many lines of text are found.  

***Instructions***
FinalV3.cpd is the codeblocks project file. 
main.cpp is my main code
searchtree.h is my header
searchTree.cpp is my compiler
dictionary.txt is my source text
1. download and compile files in new codeblocks  project
2. build and run program in codeblocks
3. input 1 reads the file in inorder to print
4. input 2 prompts to search a word, enter word and will return if/if not found in document
5. input 3 prints the document
6. input 4 reads and prints how many lines are in the document
7. input 5 quits the program
